**Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShubhkarmanSandhu/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent is a tool that will allow users to collect, monitor, compare and generate reports of system hardware specifications and performance for a group of Linux systems on a server. Programmed with bash scripts and automated with crontab for data collection and stored into a Dockerized PostgreSQL database. Collected data can be returned as a result set by using SQL queries, including detecting crontab insertion failure using SQL aggregate functions to compare the number of entries within a minute. This app was developed and run within a CentOS 7 environment using Docker.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShubhkarmanSandhu/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: A Java-based Twitter Rest API app that helps the user to Publish, Read, and Delete tweets on Twitter from CLI. TwitterApp is designed with the MVC architecture(design pattern) with a four-layer structure (Model, Controller, Service, and Data Access Layer).
  - JDBC App: Team project to deliver an app based on Java database connections API between Java and PostgreSQL.The connection is DAO pattern-based, the driver class creates and handles the connection to the database itself, two DAO classes have been developed for CRUD operations like INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Technologies used:- Java 1.8, Postgresql, Dbeaver, Maven, Docker, Git, IntelliJ IDE, SQL queries
  - Grep App: Java grep is an app that impersonates the functionality of the grep bash command of Linux (which matches a pattern in files in a given directory). The app accepts a directory path, then reads all files and matches a given pattern in each file line by line. A Docker container is also created and uploaded to use the app, along with the Fat-jar execution file. Technologies used:- Java 1.8, Maven, Docker, Git, IntelliJ IDE


## Highlighted Projects
**React Portfolio** [[GitHub](https://github.com/LordSandhu/Portfolio)]: Personal portfolio developed with React framework and published using vercel-cloud computing and GitHub pages.

**Software Design Project** [[GitHub](https://github.com/LordSandhu/ParkingTicket-Project-Java)]: Parking ticket system for Toronto using Java as backend with Java-GUI as graphic interface. State Design Pattern implemented with UML diagrams in an agile environment and dual programming.


## Professional Experiences


**Application Developer, RBC (Aug 2022 - Feb 2023)**: Spearheaded automation projects utilizing Python, SQL, Elasticsearch, and Kibana to develop sophisticated dashboards tailored for interdepartmental use. Orchestrated comprehensive data analysis initiatives and implemented stringent data governance measures, guaranteeing the precision, integrity, consistency, and punctuality of data. Played a pivotal role in identifying and rectifying discrepancies for the billing and invoicing team, culminating in a notable 35% upsurge in service revenue.

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Developed various applications using an Agile methodology. Acted as a team lead in organizing and leading daily scrum meetings with the team. Java, Linux, SQL, Docker, and bash scripts were used in development. I also gained more experience with team collaboration and organization skills related to scrum through the use of a scrum board for projects to manage my sprint backlog. Leadership was another soft skill gained from the Jarvis opportunity since every new sprint allows a developer to take on the role of team lead and direct the group in scrum meetings. My ability to problem-solve has increased because of the challenges and questions posed by the assignments to ensure that I understand the technical aspects of the projects being developed and can relate the concepts to my prior knowledge.

**Application Developer, CIBC (April 2022 -July 2022)**: Developed SQL Scripts and queries for bug fixes and testing for regular Jiras (bugs and errors) and performed an in-depth analysis of errors and issues and gave consultancy support to other developers. Helped the AML development team at Cibc in updating the legacy system into Act-One(a newer system) in an agile environment and also, worked on the ETL side of production to make sure data was transferred from all the sources to the correct channels in the Newer System.

**Front End Developer, Aavenir (India (2018-2019))**: Implemented websites, mobile applications, and landing pages from concept through deployment, standardized all output with a new, responsive, mobile-first approach and strategy, accessed UX and UI designs for technical feasibility.
