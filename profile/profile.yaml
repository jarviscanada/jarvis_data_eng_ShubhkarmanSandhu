# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a Bachelor of Computer Science graduate from Lassonde School of Engineering, York University. I came to York through an articulation program from Chitkara University, India. Before York, I worked as a trainee at Aavenir Inc, primarily focused on Front-end Development. I got this opportunity by winning a website-making Hackathon at my old School, Chitkara University. I gained solid programming, UI/UX, and designing skills while working there. Currently, I am working as a junior software developer at Jarvis, where I develop Java-based back-end apps. I am especially passionate about using technical skills to solve problems for a wide variety of stakeholders.

    description: "Developed various applications using an Agile methodology. Acted as a team lead in organizing and leading daily scrum meetings with the team. Java, Linux, SQL, Docker, and bash scripts were used in developing. I also gained more experience with team collaboration and organization skills related to scrum through the use of scrum board for projects to manage my sprint backlog. Leadership was another soft skill gained from the Jarvis opportunity since every new sprint allows a developer to take on the role of team lead and direct the group in scrum meetings. My ability to problem-solve has increased because of the challenges and questions posed by the assignments to ensure that I understand the technical aspects of the projects being developed and can relate the concepts to my prior knowledge."
